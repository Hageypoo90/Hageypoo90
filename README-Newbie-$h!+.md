  God I'm probably gonna eff this up real good, I know there are some really increbible minds here on the platform. that's why I'm here.
I cant seen to find a enviroment to learn and share and conversate in here in town. So, as one does, I turned to the interwebs for help.
Anyone who has authentic and genuine knowledge I would love to hear from you and you'r words won't fall on deaf ears. I realize I'm asking a
lot of a community that nieher needs nor has a desire to support beggeres but the worst you can do is shun me.
Im not shy, leave me something to go on and I'll come to you with questions abound and a willingness to listen and learn. SO far
so good, this is, for the moment anyway, a place I feel like I need to be; minus the lack of spelling/typing corrections, which I rely on.
  - 👀 I’m interested in ...Coding, Progamming, and devleping an understanding of the enviroments and languges that exist.
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Im a CNC operator, this is kind of all new but you can see how it would push a person to want to either
learn more or run like hell. Im a big fan of cigerettes and couches so running isn't really in my play book. Im 6ft, 160lbs, thats fine by me;
if you see me running though you should too. Something bad is behind me.
  - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Really any projects where someone is willing to give me some time and a little of their expierence.
Ill be happy to learn from anyone, knowledge is king, no matter where it comes from and im nothing if not a team player.
I am more than happy to share my schedule on a per person basis if anyone is interested in having the help or a tag along whos more
interested in the trade than anything else.
  - 📫 How to reach me ...I will list an email but it is one i made for the express purpose of only using here so that I can keep some
anonymity as i browse the web. I, like so many others, do have a life when i close the lid on this 'puter and dont really want to invite
anything to come home with me that doesnt know its limits. bennyandthecats@yahoo.com that is an address i will check daily, all things
depending I do have a cell, work, and additional contact means that I am not opposed to sharing with a like minded group in time.
                                             
                                                       Ya'll have a good 'en!! -Hagen
